"""Operator resolutions: signed closure for reconciliations.

``audit`` reports an allowed decision with no outcome (or a failed outcome) as
``needs_reconciliation`` — the external side effect may have happened, so the
operator must check the real world before retrying. This module records the
result of that check as a signed ``resolution`` event appended to the same
hash chain:

* ``confirmed_completed`` — the side effect did happen; do not retry.
* ``confirmed_not_completed`` — the side effect did not happen; retry is safe.

A resolution is an operator attestation, not proof: it says a human checked
the external system, nothing more. But it turns the reconciliation queue from
a dead end into a closed loop, and ``audit`` clears resolved invocations from
``needs_reconciliation`` accordingly. A ``confirmed_not_completed`` resolution
additionally releases an idempotency key for retry.

The referenced decision is located by id match over the live journal without
full verification (which happens at ``verify``/``audit`` time): resolve into
a journal you have verified, or not at all.
