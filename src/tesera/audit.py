"""Operational audit and reconciliation view over a verified journal.

Cryptographic verification answers whether the recorded lines were changed.
This module answers the next question an operator actually has: what happened
to each approved invocation, and which invocations still need reconciliation?

An allowed decision without an outcome is deliberately classified as
``needs_reconciliation``. The process may have died after the action started,
so neither retrying it nor calling it failed is safe.
