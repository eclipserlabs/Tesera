/**
 * Cross-process mutual exclusion without `flock` (which Node does not
 * expose): a sidecar lock *file* claimed with `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` — a single
 * atomic syscall, so exactly one contender wins and there is no
 * create-then-write race. The winner holds its fd open for the critical
 * section; losers poll. Stale locks from crashed holders are reclaimed only
 * on proof: an unreadable/partial record is left alone while fresh (the
 * writer may be mid-claim) and reclaimed once older than `staleAfterMs`;
 * a readable record is reclaimed when its pid is provably dead, or when it
 * is older than `staleAfterMs` regardless of liveness.
 *
 * Held across read-tail + append + fsync, this gives TS journals the same
 * check-then-append atomicity the Python engine gets from `fcntl`/`msvcrt`.
