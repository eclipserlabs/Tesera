"""One-command tail-truncation defense: checkpoint and ship the witness.

A checkpoint only helps if the witness actually leaves the machine before an
attacker truncates the journal. :func:`witness_journal` makes that the default
path instead of a manual two-step: it appends the signed checkpoint event and
copies the witness file into *witness_dir* (timestamped, fsynced) — a directory
that must live where the journal cannot reach (a backup mount, a second host
synced by cron, WORM storage). Optionally it also counter-signs the checkpoint
with an external key in the same run.

Run it on a schedule (cron/systemd); verify with
``tesera verify --checkpoint <dir>/latest`` or ``verify-chain``.
