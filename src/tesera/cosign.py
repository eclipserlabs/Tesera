"""Second-party counter-signatures on checkpoints.

A journal signed by one local key is a self-attestation: anyone holding the
key can rewrite history and re-sign. A ``countersignature`` event raises the
bar to *two* keys held by *two* parties — typically the operator's local key
plus a manager's, auditor's, or automated witness's key kept elsewhere.

Flow: the operator runs ``checkpoint`` as usual, then a second party runs
``tesera countersign --signing-key counter.pem``. That appends a
countersignature event (signed by the counter key, hash-chained like every
other event) committing to the newest checkpoint's ``(count, head)``. Forging
history afterwards requires both keys.

The checkpoint is looked up from the live journal without verification and
without holding the append lock: countersign while writers are quiesced, and
only countersign checkpoints you have verified (a second party signing blindly
attests to nothing). If a checkpoint lands mid-operation the attestation is
still truthful but no longer newest — the report flags ``superseded`` so you
can re-run.

The counter key must not live in the evidence home it attests to; verification
checks the countersignature against the same trusted keyring, so pass the
counter public key with ``--public-key`` (or register it in ``trusted_keys/``).
