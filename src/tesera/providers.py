"""Provider fetchers for :mod:`tesera.reconcile`: external truth, injected.

Each fetcher answers "what does the provider say about this receipt?" against
a client *you* configure and pass in — this library takes no network
dependency and performs no I/O itself, so the suite's no-socket guarantee
holds. Fetchers translate provider records into the plain mappings
:func:`reconcile_journal` compares; anything the provider cannot answer maps
to ``None`` (unknown), and transport errors propagate as fetch errors.
