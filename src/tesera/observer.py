"""The pre-execution hook: the one seam where this library can reach outward.

The guard makes no network calls. It has no configuration that would cause it
to make one, and there is no default that changes that — which is enforced by
a test that makes socket creation raise and then runs the complete flow.

Some deployments do need a central record of which actions exist: a registry
of declared contracts, a policy service that must see a contract before it
runs, a compliance system that wants the declaration ahead of the execution.
:class:`ActionObserver` is the single, explicit place to put that, and it is
inert unless a caller passes one.

Semantics, chosen so that an observer cannot weaken the guarantees:

* Called **once per contract version per process**, before approval and
  before execution. Not once per call — the contract is what it reports, and
  the contract does not change between calls.
* Never receives arguments, results, events, journals, or key material. Only
  the :class:`~tesera.contracts.ActionContract`, which is derived
  from the function's declaration and contains no runtime data.
* A failure **prevents execution**. If the observer raises, the guarded
  function does not run and nothing is recorded. There is no silent fallback:
  an observer that was asked for and could not be reached is an error, not a
  warning, because the alternative is a system that quietly stops recording
  the thing it was installed to record.
* Observing grants nothing. It is a notification, not an authorization; local
  approval and local signed evidence are unchanged by its presence.

    references fall back to an id-keyed entry holding a strong reference.
