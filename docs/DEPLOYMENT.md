# Deployment guide

How to run `tesera` in production so the guarantees survive contact with
operations. Read `THREAT_MODEL.md` first — this guide implements its
"what would strengthen it" list.

## 1. Witness on a schedule (closes tail truncation)

Preferred: systemd timers in `deploy/systemd/` (witness every 5 min, verify +
witness-audit + audit every 15 min; any non-zero exit pages via `OnFailure`):

```sh
sudo cp deploy/systemd/tesera-*.service deploy/systemd/tesera-*.timer /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable --now tesera-witness.timer tesera-verify.timer
```

Cron equivalent (when systemd is unavailable):

```cron
*/5 * * * * tesera witness --witness-dir /mnt/backup-witness >>/var/log/tesera-witness.log 2>&1
0   * * * * tesera verify --checkpoint /mnt/backup-witness/latest.checkpoint || page-oncall
```

Rules: the witness dir must live where the journal cannot reach (separate
mount, second host, WORM bucket). Alert on any non-zero `verify` exit —
including `needs_reconciliation` from `audit`, which is an operational state,
not a clean bill of health. With a second key available, pass
`--counter-key` so each witness is also countersigned. Audit the whole
directory (not just `latest`) on its own schedule — every shipped witness must
stay covered:

```cron
*/15 * * * * tesera witness-audit --witness-dir /mnt/backup-witness || page-oncall
```

For AWS, the blessed remote is an Object-Locked bucket (Compliance mode, so
not even the account root can rewrite witnesses inside the retention window):

```sh
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket evidence-witnesses --object-lock-enabled-for-bucket
aws s3api put-object-lock-configuration --bucket evidence-witnesses \
  --object-lock-configuration '{"ObjectLockEnabled":"Enabled","Rule":{"DefaultRetention":{"Mode":"COMPLIANCE","Days":365}}}'
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket evidence-witnesses --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
aws s3 sync /mnt/backup-witness s3://evidence-witnesses/$(hostname)/ --delete
```

Run `witness-audit` from a second host against its own synced copy: a journal
that passes `verify` locally but leaves a shipped witness uncovered has a
truncation (or a witness from another journal) — treat it as an incident.

Enforce the schedule in-process as well: compose `WitnessFreshnessProvider`
for `high`/`critical` actions so a missing witness or one older than
`max_age_seconds` denies before execution (fail closed). Set the max to ~2×
the cron interval; alerting stays on `verify`/`witness-audit`, the provider
is the backstop:

```python
from tesera import WitnessFreshnessProvider
from tesera.policy import AllOf

policy = AllOf(
    [
        inner_policy,
        WitnessFreshnessProvider(
            "/mnt/backup-witness",
            max_age_seconds=600,
            risks={"high", "critical"},
        ),
    ]
)
```

## 2. Rotate keys and journals

- **Signing keys**: `tesera key-rotate --journal <live>` quarterly or on
  any suspected exposure. The rotation record is witnessed in-chain; keep old
  public keys in `trusted_keys/` and pin the current fingerprint out of band.
- **Journals**: `tesera archive --keep 12` when files approach ~100k
  events (see `PERFORMANCE.md`). Keep every predecessor the live chain links
  to — `--keep` deletion destroys evidence. Verify custody end-to-end with
  `tesera verify-chain`.

## 3. Approve with identity

Export the on-call identity where agents run (`TESERA_APPROVER`, ideally
an OIDC `sub` your launcher provides) and wrap approval in
`AttestedApprovalProvider` + `QuorumApprovalProvider` for high-risk actions.
The journal then records *who* approved, and `audit` shows it.

## 4. Reconcile against providers (close the receipt loop)

A `receipt` is a transcribed claim until checked. Nightly, run
`reconcile_journal` with a fetcher over your provider and alert on anything
but `matched`:

```python
import stripe
from tesera import StripeRefundFetcher, reconcile_journal

stripe.api_key = os.environ["STRIPE_API_KEY"]  # network happens in your app, never in this lib

report = reconcile_journal(journal, keys, StripeRefundFetcher(stripe))
assert report.complete, [r for r in report.reconciliations if r.status != "matched"]
```

Record receipts in the shape the fetcher compares
(`receipt_from=lambda r: {"processor": "stripe", "refund_id": r["id"]}`).
`StripeRefundFetcher` takes your configured client instead of importing one,
so `stripe` stays an application dependency. Anything but `matched` is an
incident (`mismatched`) or a work queue (`provider_unknown`) — never a reason
to retry blindly.

AWS equivalent: write the same 20-line fetcher over CloudTrail
`LookupEvents` for the recorded request id and compare status fields.

## 5. Monitor and retain

- Alert on: `verify` failure, `audit` needing reconciliation, spending-budget
  denials spiking, witness age exceeding 2× the schedule.
- Retention: keep journals + witnesses + archived predecessors together per
  environment. A 5-minute witness schedule writes ~105k files a year, so prune
  monthly — keeping the newest witnesses preserves the strongest truncation
  bounds, only historical depth is lost (one directory per journal; never mix
  journals in one witness dir or pruning cannot stay per-journal):
  ```cron
  0 3 1 * * tesera witness-prune --witness-dir /mnt/backup-witness --keep 2000
  ```
  If erasure is required (GDPR), purge only after `inspect`
  confirms full redaction, and record the purge itself out-of-band — a gap in
  the chain is evidence of a gap, nothing more.
- Ship `FanoutJournalStore` mirrors to a second disk as a cheap second copy;
  it is a copy, not a witness — only off-host checkpoints detect truncation.
