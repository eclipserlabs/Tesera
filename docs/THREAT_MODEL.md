# Threat model

Read this before relying on the evidence for anything that matters. Most of it
is about what the journal *cannot* tell you, because that is the part people
get wrong.

## What is being protected

A record that a consequential action was declared, approved, and executed —
one that stays meaningful when the person reading it does not trust the person
who produced it.

## Trust assumptions

The guarantees hold only while all of these do:

1. **The signing key is secret.** It lives at
   `~/.tesera/signing_key.pem`, mode `0600`, unencrypted. Anyone
   who can read that file can forge an entire journal that verifies.
2. **The verifier has an authentic public key.** Verification proves a chain
   was signed by whoever holds the private half of the key you supply. If the
   attacker also supplies the public key, it proves nothing. Distribute the
   fingerprint out of band.
3. **The Python process is not compromised.** This is an in-process library.
   Code running in the same interpreter can monkey-patch the guard, call the
   underlying function directly, or read arguments before redaction.
4. **The clock is roughly right.** Timestamps come from the local clock and are
   signed, so they cannot be edited afterwards — but a wrong clock signs a
   wrong time, and nothing here detects that.

## What the evidence establishes

Given the journal file and an authentic verifying key:

| Claim | Established | How |
|---|---|---|
| An action with this contract was approved before it ran | Yes | The `decision` event is written and fsynced before the call |
| The declared code matches what was recorded | Yes, weakly | `code_fingerprint` hashes the function source when available |
| Recorded inputs hash to this value | Yes | `input_hash` over the redacted canonical form |
| Events have not been edited | Yes | Each event's signature covers its own content |
| Events have not been reordered or removed from the middle | Yes | `previous_event_hash` chains each to its predecessor |
| Each event was signed by a key the operator trusts | Yes | Ed25519 signature per event, `key_id` checked against the trusted set |

## What the evidence does not establish

### The side effect happened

This is the most important limit and the easiest to overstate. The journal
records that a Python function was called and what it returned. It does not
record what the payment processor, the cloud API, or the mail server did. A
successful `outcome` event means the function returned without raising — which
is evidence about your process, not about the world.

Anyone describing this as proof that a refund occurred is describing something
this library does not do.

### Tail truncation

Deleting entries from the **end** of the journal is undetectable from the
journal alone. Every remaining event still chains correctly, because a chain
has no idea how long it was supposed to be.

`tests/test_evidence.py::test_truncated_tail_is_not_detectable` asserts this
deliberately, so the limitation cannot quietly stop being true without someone
noticing.

The `checkpoint` command closes it with a durable witness. It appends a signed
`checkpoint` event committing to the event count, and writes the event's
canonical JSON line to a witness file. Save that witness somewhere the journal
cannot reach (a backup, a second machine, a message); `verify --checkpoint`
then fails any journal with fewer events than the checkpoint committed to —
i.e., a tail truncated at or before the checkpoint. The witness is validated
cryptographically, so it cannot be forged without the signing key. The
remaining residual is a process that truncates *and* re-signs from the private
key, which is the same full-forgery assumption that covers every other
modification.

Counter-signatures from a second party, or shipping events to an append-only
remote as they are written, would detect even re-signing truncation. The
`ActionObserver` hook is not that — it sees contracts, not events.
`FanoutJournalStore` + `FileMirrorSink` ship every event to witness sinks as
written (fail-closed by default; a ship failure raises `EventShipError`
without silently dropping the witness), and `tesera witness` checkpoints
and ships the witness off-host in one cron-ready command. Operating the remote
end — a second disk, a WORM bucket, a second host — remains yours; see
`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`. The `countersign` command is a partial answer: a second
key held elsewhere signs the newest checkpoint in-chain, so rewriting history
afterwards requires both keys. It does not cover events after the
countersignature, and a second party that signs blindly attests to nothing —
countersign only checkpoints you have verified.

### Resolutions are attestations, not evidence

A `resolution` event says an operator claims to have checked the external
system. It is signed and chained like everything else, but its *content* rests
on operator honesty: `confirmed_not_completed` followed by a retry that double-
charges is an operator error the journal faithfully records, not a forgery it
prevents. Conflicting resolutions and resolutions contradicting a `succeeded`
outcome are flagged by `audit` rather than resolved silently, for exactly this
reason.

### Receipts are transcribed claims

A `receipt` binds external reference IDs (a processor's refund id) into the
signed outcome — but the extractor runs against the guarded function's *return
value*, inside the same trust domain as the function itself. A function that
lies about the refund id produces a faithfully-signed lie. Receipts upgrade
"the function returned" to "the function named this external record", which
makes later reconciliation against provider statements possible; they do not
verify the provider did anything.

### Archiving preserves custody, pruning destroys it

Each `archive` event links its file to the predecessor's `(count, head)`, so
custody survives rotation as long as every file is kept. `--keep` deletion is
an operator decision to destroy evidence: pruned archives cannot be verified
afterwards, and a chain of custody with a missing link proves nothing about
the gap. Archive storage, like checkpoints and counter-keys, must live where
the live journal cannot reach — otherwise rotation is just slower truncation.

### The approval web page is phishing-adjacent

`ApprovalServer` shows the redacted summary only, and its token URL is a bearer
credential: anyone holding it can approve pending actions from the LAN. Serve
it on loopback unless approving from another device is the point, keep the URL
out of logs and chat, and treat an approval clicked on an unfamiliar page as a
denial. A quorum of two independent approvers (`QuorumApprovalProvider`) beats
one approver with a leaked URL.

### A dishonest process

Nothing prevents code in the same process from calling the unguarded function.
The decorator is a convention enforced at the call site, not a sandbox. Evidence
shows what went *through* the guard, and cannot show what went around it.

### Content of unsupported objects

Values that are not JSON-native, dataclasses, or named tuples are recorded as
`<unsupported:module.TypeName>`. This is deliberate — calling `repr()` would
leak whatever the object holds — but it means the evidence does not commit to
those arguments' contents. An action whose meaningful input is a rich object is
weakly evidenced.

### Secrets you did not name

Redaction is name-based, plus a narrow set of high-precision value patterns
(`sk-live-…`, `ghp_…`, `xoxb-…`, `AKIA…`, PEM private keys, JWTs, and caller
regexes via `redact_patterns`). A secret passed as `data` or `payload` that
matches no pattern is not redacted, because nothing marks it as sensitive.
Use `redact=[...]` and `redact_patterns=[...]`, and use
`tesera inspect` to see what a journal would actually disclose
before sharing it.

Name-based redaction also cannot help with a secret embedded inside a larger
string unless a value pattern matches the whole value — note patterns replace
the *entire string value*, so `prefix sk-live-… suffix` is fully redacted,
while an unrecognized embedding (a token inside a JSON blob passed as text
with no matching pattern) passes through. Value patterns are best-effort
against novel secret formats: they cover known prefixes, not arbitrary entropy.

### Idempotency scope

`idempotency_key` blocks a second execution after a recorded `succeeded`
outcome; it does not replay results and does not prove the external side
effect happened exactly once — a crash between the side effect and the outcome
write still leaves `needs_reconciliation`, and a concurrent duplicate in
another process can pass the check before either outcome is recorded (the
second writer then records a denied duplicate or a second success, which
`audit` flags as `duplicate_idempotency_key`). Custom `JournalStore`
implementations are deduplicated within the process only.

### Unicode lookalikes

Names are matched against the sensitive set after Unicode folding — NFKC
(collapsing fullwidth, compatibility, and mathematical-alphanumeric forms),
stripping combining marks, transliterating common Cyrillic and Greek
lookalikes, then casefolding. `api_kеy` (Cyrillic е), `ａpi_key` (fullwidth a),
and `тoken` (Cyrillic т) are redacted exactly like their ASCII spellings.

This is best-effort. The folding table covers the homoglyph classes in
practical use, but no name-based scheme can defeat arbitrary Unicode, and the
original spelling — not the folded form — is what appears in evidence. A field
name that is merely *near* a sensitive name (a misspelling, a separator
change) is not redacted.

## Residual risks worth stating plainly

**Low-entropy values are recoverable from hashes.** `input_hash` is over the
redacted structure, so redacted values are gone. But a *non*-redacted argument
with a small domain — a four-digit PIN, a boolean, an account from a known
list — can be recovered by hashing every candidate. Redaction replaces values
with a fixed literal precisely so this does not apply to them; it does apply to
everything you did not redact.

**Key compromise is retroactive and total — unless you rotate.** Rotation
(`key-rotate`) replaces the signing key; the outgoing public key stays in the
local `trusted_keys/` directory so old evidence keeps verifying. That bounds a
compromise going forward: an attacker who obtains only the *current* key can
forge new events but cannot forge events signed by a *previous* key, because the
verifier checks each event's `key_id` against the set of keys that actually
signed it. It does not bound the past — a stolen key can still be used to
rewrite events that were signed with that same key — and the trusted set is
local operator state, not a signature, so it authenticates nothing by itself.
For real authentication, pin the public key out of band with `--public-key`.

**Concurrent writers on exotic platforms.** Appends take an in-process lock plus
an OS file lock (`fcntl` on Unix, `msvcrt` on Windows). On a platform with
neither, two processes writing the same journal can interleave. Verification
detects the result as a chain error rather than accepting it silently, so this
degrades to a false alarm rather than a false negative.

**`ExecutionCompletedEvidenceError` is a real state, not a theoretical one.**
The function ran and the outcome could not be persisted. The side effect may
have happened. It is a distinct exception type because the caller must decide
what to do, and automatic retry is unsafe.

The offline `audit` command also surfaces the adjacent crash state: an allowed
decision with no outcome. It labels that invocation `needs_reconciliation`.
Both that state and a recorded function failure make the command exit non-zero,
because the external side effect may have completed before an exception or
process death. This prevents a clean cryptographic verification from being
misread as a clean operational run, but it still cannot determine the external
result; an operator must check the provider or target system before retrying.

## What would strengthen it

In rough order of value per unit of work:

1. **Checkpoint the tail.** Periodically record `(length, last_event_hash)`
   somewhere separate. Closes the largest gap. (Implemented: `checkpoint`.)
2. **Counter-sign.** A second party signing periodic checkpoints turns a
   self-attestation into something closer to a witnessed one. (Implemented:
   `countersign` with an external key; still manual and per-checkpoint, not
   continuous remote shipping.)
3. **Hardware-backed keys.** A key in a TPM, Secure Enclave, or HSM cannot be
   copied out of the file, which addresses trust assumption 1 directly.
4. **Signed rotation records.** The trusted set today is local operator state;
   a signed, witnessed rotation event would let a compromise of the *current*
   key have a cleanly bounded blast radius instead of an operator-managed one.
   (Implemented: `key-rotate` appends a `rotation` event signed by the outgoing
   key naming its successor; verification checks the linkage. The trusted set
   itself is still local operator state — pin keys out of band.)

Item 3 is not implemented. Continuous remote shipping is partially addressed:
`FanoutJournalStore` + `FileMirrorSink` mirror every event to witness sinks as
written (fail-closed by default), and `verify-chain` checks custody across
`archive` rotations — but operating the remote witness itself remains yours.
